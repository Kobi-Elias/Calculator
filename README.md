# Calculator
this calculater keeps showing "referenceError: document is not defined". 
I cannot figure out what the problem seems to be as document is not my variable i am only using it to run a DOM query.
any one who knows how to fix the issue feel free to edit the code with notes and push it to github i would love to see the solution
